This module is Constant Current(CC) and Constant Voltage(CV) converter and this  Constant Current (CC), and Constant Voltage (CV) converter can come in very handy in various conditions, for example, if we  want to charge a lithium battery with a constant current we can do that very easily with this module. If we are testing a circuit and powering it for the first time it's always recommended to use a constant current that will limit damage to your circuit if you made any mistakes in the build process.
