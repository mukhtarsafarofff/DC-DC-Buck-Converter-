This module is Constant Current(CC) and Constant Voltage(CV) converter and this  Constant Current (CC), and Constant Voltage (CV) converter can come in very handy in various conditions, for example, if we  want to charge a lithium battery with a constant current we can do that very easily with this module. If we are testing a circuit and powering it for the first time it's always recommended to use a constant current that will limit damage to your circuit if you made any mistakes in the build process.We have the DC input connector, which is to connect to an unregulated power source.We have two 10K potentiometers that are used to set the constant current and voltage level. There are three LED indicators on the board; the first one near the input connector shows when the module is in constant current mode, while the other two near the output are mainly for battery charging applications.The constant output current of the module is 5A and it can reach up to 96% efficiency while working.There TL431 is a reference that is set to a constant current regulator mode with the help of a 72K resistor and a potentiometer. This reference is compared to the sense voltage from the output side of the resistor to limit the current.
